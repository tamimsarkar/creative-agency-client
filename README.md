In the HomePage there are six sections on Header-section <br />
`header , companie,service,caroussels,reviws footer`
Creatice-agency service
onClick of every service changes their route to order a service route.but that door is open conditionally.If the user is logged In then it will go through the order route.otherwise it will go throw login page there user have to login with google.after login seccess it will auto redirect to the order route.

User can request for order an service,add review for perticular service and see list of his ordered list.
